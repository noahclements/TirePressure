HIGH SCHOOL CS120 JAVA PROJECT

Write a Java program that allows a garage attendant to check a customer’s tire pressure.  The attendant should measure the tire pressure in all 4 tires and then use your program to check the information.  The attendant will input the information for each of the four tires.

The program output should tell the attendant that "Tire inflation is ok" if all three of the following conditions are true:

1.	the pressure is the same in both front tires. 
2.	the pressure is the same in both back tires (but not necessarily the same as in the front). 
3.	the tire pressure is between 32 and 38 psi.
